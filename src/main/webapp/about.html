	<br/><b>About us</b><br/><br/>
	ResponDog is an audience response application that poses your quiz questions or seeks opinions from your 
	audience. Originally designed for teaching college classes, ResponDog is also great for presenters and 
	trainers working with a group of business professionals. Keeping your audience active and engaged with the 
	presentation is important. Polling helps, and ResponDog makes it easy.<br/><br/>
	
	ResponDog works with your learning management system (LMS) and returns participant scores back to the LMS 
	grade book automatically. The instructor/presenter can also review the individual responses of each participant.

	ResponDog has earned the 
	<a href='https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications/chemvantage/respondog'>1EdTech Trusted App Data Privacy Certification</a> 
	for its Privacy Policy and practices, which protect users' personally identifiable information (PII). The registration number is 
	IMSP1ce2023W1. Users connect to ResponDog through your institution's LMS, and ResponDog returns all user scores to the LMS, 
	so we don't store any user PII on our servers. That way, your information is 100% secure.

	<div class='seg1'>
	<br/><b>Privacy Policy</b><br/><br/>
	ResponDog protects its users' privacy to the maximum extent that allows the site to function as designed.<ul><li><b>
	Personally identifiable information (PII)</b> - Except for LMS administrators, instructors and facilitators who contact  
	ResponDog directly (e.g., to establish an account or provide feedback), ResponDog 
	does not store any user PII. ResponDog does not process, collect or store any user credit card or 
	financial information whatsoever.</li><li><b>Digital Tracking</b> - ResponDog does not use cookies, web analytics, 
	web beacons, pixel tags or any other type of digital tracking devices. We do not store information about IP addresses, 
	locations, or browser information of our users. We do not display any advertisements or enter into any service agreements 
	with third party advertisers.</li><li><b>User IDs</b> - During each user's session, ResponDog issues a secure token that 
	is linked to an opaque user ID to ensure both privacy and security. For LTI users, this ID is provided by the learning 
	management system (LMS). LTI is a secure messaging and communications standard developed by 
	<a href=https://1edtech.org target=_blank aria-label='opens new tab'>1EdTech</a> (formerly IMS Global Learning Solutions). 
	LTI connects students and instructors with educational service providers. ResponDog is a 
	<a href=https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications/chemvantage/36981/chemvantage target=_blank aria-label='opens new tab'>
	certified LTI provider</a>. Users who enter ResponDog through our home page are assigned a random ID number 
	and are informed that they are participating as anonymous users.</li><li><b>Data and Information Collected</b> 
	- ResponDog collects and stores data and information about the quizzes, homework assignments and practice exams 
	that are downloaded by our users, including customized assignments, individual responses to question items, assignment 
	scores and timestamps. All data and information transmitted to or from ResponDog are protected by TLS/SSL encryption 
	while in transit, and are stored in encrypted form on Google Cloud Datastore servers while at rest. All user data are 
	solely owned by the user and may be deleted upon request to <a href=mailto:admin@chemvantage.org>admin@chemvantage.org</a>.</li>
	<li><b>How We Use Data and Information that We Collect</b> - For LTI users, individual user scores, data and information 
	are available to the user, the instructor (as identified by the LMS) and to the LMS administrators. User scores may be 
	reported by ResponDog directly back to the LMS grade book via the LTI Outcomes Service if this service is supported 
	by the LMS.<br/>For all users, including anonymous users entering the site through our home page, we use scores, 
	responses and user comments/feedback to improve the quality of individual question items in the site as well as site 
	navigation and user experience. We also use timestamps to automatically delete user data and LMS accounts after one 
	year of inactivity.</li><li><b>Information That We Share</b> - We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose user 
	information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court 
	order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. Otherwise, ResponDog does not and will not share 
	any user data or information with anyone except the user's LMS and with instructors and administrators who are identified 
	by the LMS through the LTI interface.</li><li><b>Google reCAPTCHA</b> - ResponDog uses the Google reCAPTCHA tool on 
	its LTI registration page to detect bots and prevent spam and abuse. To register your LMS with ResponDog you must 
	accept the Google reCAPTCHA Terms of Service and the Google API Terms of service. This is not required of users who are 
	accessing ResponDog resources through the LTI interface (i.e., students and instructors) or users who enter ResponDog 
	through the home page anonymously.</li></ul>
